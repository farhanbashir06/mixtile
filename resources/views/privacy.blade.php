            Policy.
        </p>
        <p>
            To determine the appropriate retention period, we consider the amount, nature,
            and sensitivity of the Personal Data, the potential risk of harm from
            unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Data, the purposes for which we
            process your Personal Data and whether those purposes can be achieved through
            other means, as well as applicable legal requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
            We will also keep and use such Personal Data for as long as is required in order
            to comply with our legal and contractual obligations, or to protect ourselves
            from any potential disputes (i.e., as required by laws applicable to records and
            bookkeeping, and in order to have proof and evidence concerning our relationship
            or your use of our Services, should any legal issues arise in the future), in

            Images in particular will be retained until your account has been terminated,

            You may ask us to delete any Personal Data, including Images, by sending us an

            systems, without notice to you, including once we deem it no longer necessary
            for the purposes set forth in this Privacy Policy. We may also retain your data
            in an anonymized form.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please note that unless required by applicable law, we will not be obligated to

            Individuals have rights concerning their Personal Data. If you wish to exercise

            General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or the California Consumer Privacy Act
            (CCPA)), such as the right to request access to, and rectification or erasure of

            Data’s processing, or to port such Personal Data, or the right to equal services

        <p>
            When you ask us to exercise any of your rights under this Privacy Policy or
            applicable law, we may need to ask you to provide us certain credentials to make
            sure that you are who you claim you are, to avoid disclosure of Personal Data
            relating to other individuals, and to ask you to provide further information to
            better understand the nature and scope of data that you wish to access or have
            deleted etc. Such additional data will be then retained by us for legal purposes
            (e.g. as proof of the identity of the person submitting the request), in
            accordance with <a href="#heading=h.1t3h5sf">Section 4</a> above. We may redact

        <p>
            Certain data protection laws and regulations, such as the GDPR or the CCPA,
            typically distinguish between two main roles for parties processing Personal
            Data: the “<strong>data controller</strong>” (or under the CCPA,
            “<strong>business</strong>”), who determines the purposes and means of
            processing; and the “<strong>data processor</strong>” (or under the CCPA,
            “<strong>service provider</strong>”), who processes the data on behalf of the
            data controller (or business). Below we explain how these roles apply to our
            Services, to the extent that such laws and regulations apply.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Saychizzs is a “co-controller” of certain portions of its Users’
                data</strong>, alongside such Service Providers that process Personal Data for
            both Saychizzs’s analytics and marketing purposes - and the Service Providers’
            own purposes. In such cases, such Service Providers (e.g. Facebook and Google)
            will in such circumstances be deemed as “co-controllers” of such data, which
            would typically relate to Users who also use the Service Provider’s own
            platforms. If you wish to limit such independent activities by these Service
            Providers, consider disabling third-party cookies as detailed in
            <a href="#sec_6" class="inner-link">Section 6</a> above.
