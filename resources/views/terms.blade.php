            <strong>Saychizzs Terms of Service</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Here’s an overview of our terms. We highly recommend that you read our complete
            legal information below, because that's the one that really counts. (Plus, who
            doesn't enjoy reading a good, long Terms of Service now and again?) If you just
            want the highlights – or spoilers, as the legal team likes to think of them –
            here are a few of the most important bits, in plain English.
        </p>
        <ul>

                <li><strong>You still own all the pictures you order from us. </strong>You keep
                    the copyright to all of your images. We won’t sell them, share them, or use them
                    for anything other than getting your tiles printed and delivered to you.
                </li>

        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>We need access to your photo gallery to show you your pictures in
                the Saychizzs app. </strong>When you open our app for the first time, it’ll ask
                you for permission to access your photos. We need that so we can let you select,
                crop, and order your pics in our app. If you want, you can turn that permission
                off in your settings later or delete the app to remove the permission.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>If you want, we’ll delete all your pictures and personal data from
                our systems</strong>. All you need to do is send us an email to<a href="hi@saychizz.com">&nbsp;hi@saychizz.com</a>&nbsp;from the email address you
                entered when you made your order.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>You agree not to order any pictures you don’t own, or any
                pornography or discriminatory content. </strong>There are lots of people
                involved in the printing process, so we can’t print any images with nudity or
                offensive content. We also can’t print pictures that you don’t have the right to
                use. If you do send us a picture that doesn't belong to you and we are sued by
                the rightful owner, you'll be responsible for all related costs.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>If there’s a problem with your tiles or if there are any other
                issues</strong>, just send us an email to<a href="hi@saychizz.com">
                hi@saychizz.com</a>&nbsp;or a chat through the app. We’ll do our best to get it all
                sorted out.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <span style="text-decoration:underline;">The Actual Terms of Service</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            Saychizzs (as defined below) allows users to upload images and/or pictures
            ("<strong>Images</strong>") to our website ("<strong>Site</strong>") or our
            mobile application (together with the Site, "<strong>App</strong>") in order to

            "<strong>You</strong>" means any adult user of the App or Services or any parent
            or guardian of any minor whom you allow to use the App or the Services, and for
            whom you will be held strictly responsible.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please read these Terms carefully. By clicking on the button marked "I agree"
            you signify your assent to these Terms. Changes may be made to these Terms from
            time to time. If you do not agree to any of these Terms, please do not click the

                <strong>Use of the Services</strong>
                <p>
                    Use of the Services and access to the App is void where prohibited. By using the
                    Services, you represent and warrant that (a) all information you submit is
                    truthful and accurate; (b) you are 18 years of age or older or have your
                    parent's or guardian's permission to enter into these Terms, and (c) have the
                    ability to form a binding contract; (d) your use of the App or Services does not
                    violate any applicable law or regulation or any obligation you may have to a
                    third party; (e) your use of the App and Services shall be in compliance with
                    all applicable laws and regulations; (f) you are solely responsible for
                    obtaining the consent of the parent or guardian ("<strong>Parental
                    Consent</strong>") before transferring us any information, including images, of
                    any children.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Certain categories of Personal Data are subject to special protections under
                    Regulation 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April
                    2016 (General Data Protection Regulation, hereafter "<strong>GDPR</strong>").
                    These include Personal Data relating to among others, a person's racial origin,
                    religious beliefs, health, sexual orientation, listed in Article 9 of the GDPR
                    ("<strong>Special Categories of Data</strong>") and Personal Data related to
                    children (together with Special Categories of Data, "<strong>Sensitive
                    Data</strong>"). You hereby represent and warrant that you will not add any
                    Images that contain Sensitive Data unless you have obtained explicit consent if
                    and as required under applicable law from the relevant individual (including
                    Parental Consent if and as required) and that you shall be solely responsible
                    and liable for any such Sensitive Data, including in the event of any data
                    breach relating to the Services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You may use the App and the Services in accordance with and subject to these
                    Terms. Saychizzs may change, update, or discontinue certain parts of the App or
                    the Services. These changes would not apply to any outstanding orders and we'll
                    make an effort to notify you of any fundamental changes, including by way of
                    notice in the App.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to use the App, you will be required to provide certain information as
                    may be requested by Saychizzs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You may have the option to link the App with certain third-party services, as
                    may be listed in the App from time to time, such as your Facebook, Google
                    Photos, or Instagram account ("<strong>Linked Account</strong>"). By doing so,
                    you represent and warrant that you have the authority to provide Saychizzs with
                    access to account information related to such Linked Account, and to provide
                    Saychizzs with access to photos or pictures saved in such Linked Account.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You are fully and solely responsible for the security of your computer system
                    and/or mobile phone and/or other device and all of your activity on the App. We
                    do not police for and cannot guarantee that we will learn of or prevent any
                    inappropriate use of the App.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Subject to applicable law, Saychizzs may, for any reason, at its sole discretion
                    and without notice, discontinue or refuse to provide you with the App or
                    Services. Grounds for such refusal may include but are not limited to (i)
                    violation of the letter or spirit of these Terms, (ii) fraudulent, harassing or
                    abusive behavior, (iii) behavior that is illegal or harmful to other users,
                    third parties, or the business interests of Saychizzs, breach of your
                    representations and warranties herein or breach of any of the terms of these
                    Terms, or (v) use of your chargeback rights with your credit card company or
                    denial or dispute of any preapproval obtained by Saychizzs from your credit card
                    company.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If we believe, at our sole discretion, that a violation of these Terms or any
                    illegal or inappropriate behavior has occurred, we may take any other corrective
                    action we deem appropriate. We reserve the right to investigate suspected
                    violations of these Terms or illegal and inappropriate behavior on the App. We
                    will fully cooperate with any law enforcement investigation or court order
                    requesting or directing us to disclose the identity, behavior or (User) Content
                    (as defined below) of anyone believed to have violated these Terms or to have
                    engaged in illegal behavior in connection with the App and/or the Services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Any suspension, termination, or cancellation of Services shall not affect your
                    obligations to Saychizzs under these Terms (including but not limited to
                    ownership, indemnification, limitation of liability and payment obligation), nor
                    will it affect any other terms herein, which by their sense and context are
                    intended to survive such suspension, termination, or cancellation.
                </p>

                <strong>Content and User Content</strong>
                <p>
                    Certain types of content may be made available through the App or the Services.
                    "<strong>Content</strong>" as used in these Terms means, collectively, all
                    content on or made available on the App or through the Services, including any
                    images, photos, pictures, and any modifications or derivatives of the foregoing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The App may allow you to upload certain content including but not limited to
                    Images and photos. All content uploaded by you is referred to as "<strong>User
                    Content</strong>." User Content may include Sensitive Data. You are and shall
                    remain at all times fully and solely responsible for any User Content you upload
                    to the App. YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT ANY SUCH USER CONTENT COMPLIES WITH
                    ALL APPLICABLE LAW, THAT YOU HAVE ALL NECESSARY RIGHTS AND AUTHORITIES TO SUBMIT
                    ANY SUCH USER CONTENT THROUGH THE APP AND SERVICES, AND THAT NO SUCH USER
                    CONTENT INFRINGES OR VIOLATES ANY THIRD PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS,
                    PRIVACY OR PUBLICITY RIGHTS, OR MORAL RIGHTS. YOU FURTHER REPRESENT AND WARRANT
                    THAT YOU HAVE OBTAINED ALL RIGHTS AS REQUIRED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, TO PROVIDE
                    SaychizzS WITH SENSITIVE DATA FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROCESSING SUCH SENSITIVE DATA

                    IS SUBMITTED THROUGH THE APP AND SERVICES. Saychizzs has no obligation to accept
                    any request to print or maintain any User Content. Moreover, Saychizzs reserves
                    the right to remove and permanently delete any User Content uploaded by you,
                    without notice and for any reason. WE DO NOT ENDORSE ANY CONTENT (INCLUDING
                    WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY USER CONTENT) OR ANY OPINION, RECOMMENDATION, OR ADVICE
                    EXPRESSED IN ANY CONTENT, AND WE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL LIABILITY IN

                    WE DISCLAIM ALL LIABILITY, REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, FOR THE ACTS OR
                    OMISSIONS OF USERS (INCLUDING UNAUTHORIZED USERS) THAT ARE NOT DUE TO SaychizzS'S

                    DURING THE USE OF THE SERVICE OR OTHERWISE.

                <p>
                    Saychizzs may retain the User Content, including Images (including in your
                    account as your order history) as long as your account is valid and has not been
                    terminated by you or by us, for any reason. You may ask us to delete any User
                    Content, including Images, by sending us an email, specifying your request, as
                    detailed in our Privacy Notice. Any Images uploaded by you to the Services and
                    not elected by you to be printed on Tiles will be automatically deleted after
                    thirty (30) days from the day you have uploaded the Image(s).

                            We would like you to be happy with your Tile(s). If we made a mistake in
                            preparing your Tiles or if they arrived damaged, we will be more than happy to
                            provide a refund. Of course, you made a mistake in ordering or just changed your
                            mind, then, subject to applicable law, your order would not be eligible for a
                            refund.

                            request to our address at Ahad Ha'Am 54, Tel Aviv-Yafo, Israel 6520216. If the
                            reason you would like a refund is that the Tiles you received were not printed
                            correctly or there is some other damage, it would be helpful if you would
                            include a picture of the Tiles along with your request.

                            If you are from the European Union and you are contracting with Saychizzs B.V.,
                            as detailed above, these Terms shall be governed solely by the laws of the
                            Netherlands, and the competent courts in the Netherlands shall have exclusive
                            jurisdiction to hear any disputes arising hereunder. If you are from the US and
                            you are contracting with Saychizzs USA, Inc., as detailed above, these Terms
                            shall be governed solely by the laws of the State of New York, and the competent
                            courts in the State of New York shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear any
                            disputes arising hereunder. If you are from elsewhere and you are contracting
                            with Saychizzs Ltd., as detailed above, these Terms shall be governed solely by
                            the laws of the State of Israel and the competent courts in the State of Israel

                            event that any provision of these Terms is held to be unenforceable, such
                            provision shall be replaced with an enforceable provision which most closely
                            achieves the effect of the original provision, and the remaining terms of these
                            Terms shall remain in full force and effect. Nothing in these Terms creates any
                            agency, employment, joint venture, or partnership relationship between you and
                            Saychizzs or enables you to act on behalf of Saychizzs. Except as may be expressly
                            stated in these Terms, these Terms constitute the entire agreement between us

                            agreements existing between us relating thereto are hereby canceled. We may
                            assign and/or transfer our rights and obligations hereunder to any third party
                            without prior notice. You shall not assign and/or transfer any of your rights or
                            obligations hereunder, and any assignment in violation of the foregoing shall be
                            void. No waiver of any breach or default hereunder shall be deemed to be a
                            waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default. If we are required to
                            provide notice to you hereunder, we may provide such notice to the contact
                            details you provided upon registration.
